# Ice Cream Delivery Landing Page

The Ice Cream Landing Page is a visually engaging, pixel-perfect frontend project built with React.js, inspired by a vibrant and interactive Figma design. The primary objective was to replicate the UI design exactly, while ensuring responsiveness, interactivity, and clean code organization.

This landing page captures the essence of a modern ice cream brand, blending bold typography, fun color palettes, and interactive visuals. The application adapts smoothly across all screen sizes and maintains a fluid user experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

The entire frontend is powered using React functional components and hooks only, following best practices in component modularization, CSS organization, and scalability.



> ðŸŽ¯ This project was built as part of a selection task, with strict adherence to the provided design system including layout, colors, typography, spacing, and responsiveness.
